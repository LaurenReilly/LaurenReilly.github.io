                    <h3>Actor</h3>
                    <p>I've been pursing a career in acting and entertainment for the past few years. I've worked in and studied film, tv, commercials, and stand up comedy.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="hidden gaming">
                <h3 >Gamer</h3>
                <p>Survival, strategy, adventure, and simulation are my favorite genres. I enjoy PC and console gaming. Games are the reason I want to learn to code!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden cats">
                <h3>Cat Lover</h3>
                <p>Cats are the best. My three cats are my best friends. Is that sad? I don't think so.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden collector">               
                <h3>Collector</h3>
                <p>Finding things makes me happy. I collect Native American artifacts and gems.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden degree">
                 <h3>BA in Creative Writing</h3>
                <p>I've probably written fifteen words since graduation. Ok thats a hyperbole (which I know because of my degree! See it wasn't useless.)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden fantasy">
                <h3>Fantasy Reader</h3>
                <p>I have read and re-read the same three series (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and A Song of Ice and Fire) an embarassing amount of times. Can't stop. Won't stop.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden cartoons">
                 <h3>Cartoon and Movie Enthusiast</h3>
                <p>I'm a big fan of movies and cartoons! My favorite cartoon is Steven Universe and my favorite move is Scott Pilgrim vs The World.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden married">
                <h3 >Married</h3>
                <p>I never had a wedding because I'm not the type but my best friend and I are a perfect match. He is better than me at Mario Kart but I'm ok with that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden aquarium">
                <h3>Aquascaper</h3>
                <p>I've been in the hobby since age 6. I've learned a lot about fish husbandry since then and now I focus on creating pristine underwater landscapes with wood, rocks, and live plants for my aquatic friends to thrive in.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="hidden selftaught">
                <h3>Self Taught</h3>
                <p>A few years ago I thought that all code was done in binary. No joke. I've learned a lot since then but also very little. I got serious about learning coding as it pertains to web development when I got accepted to Digital Crafts in April.</p>
